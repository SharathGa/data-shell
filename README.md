I have deleted the files in the local system, that I unsuccessfully wasnt able to merge. So now I am going to do 
the follwing steps. 


Step 1 : This is written in local file.

Step 2L : This is written in local, and now we will try to solve the merge conflict again. 

Good luck Sharath. 

Step 3L: Trying to create another merge conflict from local.

Finally, this is the text that I will be accepting as my answer.

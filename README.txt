This is the second time I am creating a file and 
sending it the remote github and creating a repo. 


After a lot of struggle, I am able to set the remote repo correctly
and now I will attempt again to send it to the github. 

Now,since the username does not seem to change, I am logging into 
my earlier created SharathGa account and then I am sending the code 
to cloud. This must work now. Hopefully. 


This the change that i made on github.

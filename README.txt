This is the second time I am creating a file and 
sending it the remote github and creating a repo. 


After a lot of struggle, I am able to set the remote repo correctly
and now I will attempt again to send it to the github. 

Now,since the username does not seem to change, I am logging into 
my earlier created SharathGa account and then I am sending the code 
to cloud. This must work now. Hopefully. fuck this bro.  

Finally I have deleted the config file, I hope this will work now. 

I was able to send the data tot the cloud feels good.
